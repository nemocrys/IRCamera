# IRCamera

Record infrared images with an Optris PI640 Camera on Linux.

The project is developed and maintained by the [**Model experiments group**](https://www.ikz-berlin.de/en/research/materials-science/section-fundamental-description#c486) at the Leibniz Institute for Crystal Growth (IKZ).

## Usage

To record images use the script *run_ircamera.py* and the parameter file *settings.yml*.

There is an issue with the configuration of emissivities, currently only a value of 1 can be set.

The IR Camera is configured in *20112117.xml* (only valid for the specific device used in the NEMOCRYS project, [adjustment required for other cameras](http://documentation.evocortex.com/libirimager2/html/Installation.html)) and accessed using the Camera class defined in *ircamera.py*. FiloCara's interface [pyoptris](https://github.com/FiloCara/pyOptris/blob/dev/setup.py) is used for accessing the camera, it's located in the *source* direcotry.
